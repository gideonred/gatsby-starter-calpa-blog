## Chill Time

This is for those days you want to make some time to yourself. Perfect for when you're on your way to sit in the park and read your favorite book.

My favorite memory from this MoodJourney is reading Bluets in Prospect Park last July.

For that just took a bubble bath kind of feeling.
